-- Applied electrical current
-- The direction of X-Axis is defined as the direction of electrical current so only jx is applied
-- Need two functions: 

-- t from 0 to 1
function GetJxValueInPeroid(t)
    return 1.0
end

-- the length of the peroid (steps)
function GetJxPeroidLength()
    return 1
end
